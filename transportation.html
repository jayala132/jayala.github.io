          Traveling to and within the island is a breeze! Almost all visitors
          arrive to Taniti by air, thoush some arrive ona small cruise ship that
          docs in Yellow Leaf Bay for one night per week. Taniti is served by a
          small airport that can accommodate small jets and propeller planes.
          Taniti is in the process of expanidng the airport so larger jets will
          be able to land on the island within the next few years.
        </p>

          There are number of transportation modes to choose from once on the
          island. Public buses serve Taniti City and run from 5 a.m. to 11 p.m.
          every day. Private buses serve the rest of the island. Taxis are
          available in Taniti City, and rental cars can be rented from a local
          rental agency near the airport. Bikes and helmets are available to
          rent from several vendors (helmets are required by law.) Taniti City
          is fairly flat and very walkable. many tourists stay in the area
          surrounding Merriton Landing: this area is easy to explore on foot.
